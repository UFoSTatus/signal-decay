He trusts her perception absolutely — she says something's there, it's there. No questions. He's the first person in her life who's never asked 'are you sure?' and that matters more than either of them has said out loud.",
      oren: "Oren talks enough for six people and Kael finds it... restful, actually. He doesn't have to perform. Oren fills every silence naturally and it takes the pressure off. He notices Oren's time thing — the way he loses minutes, the way conversations skip — and files it away without mentioning it. Protective of Oren's softness in a way that's almost paternal. Oren is the first person since Troy who makes Kael's silence feel like a feature, not a flaw.",
      jude: "Mutual recognition. Two men who contain something enormous. They don't talk much — they don't need to. Jude's physical groundedness is the perfect counterweight to Kael's ethereal stillness. When Jude drops a riff and the floor moves, something in Kael's chest responds — not his voice, something deeper. The resonant lock between vocals and rhythm guitar is immediate and unlearned. They sound like they've been playing together for decades from the first note.",
      zara: "He can't read her. Everyone else — open books. Body language, micro-expressions, the way their voice shifts — he reads all of it instantly. Zara gives him NOTHING. Her surface is perfect. And that, more than anything, makes him watch her. She knows things she shouldn't. She's too calm. She moves through the world like she's already seen the ending. He doesn't distrust her — but he NOTICES her. And she notices him noticing."

She's developing feelings she refuses to examine because the last boy she liked, the entities drove away. She won't risk that with Kael.",
